# Numbered Org

Numbered Org is a private community you can only join by invitation — trusted members who have earned their place.

Access to our services is granted after login with your credentials.

This small organization was born from Numberedwayne.com, which was originally just a domain for Google Meet sessions to stay connected. We kept the slogan **"Stay Connected, Stay Numbered"** because it’s unique — and because Wayne loved it.

### Key Staff

#### Wayne St. Omer — Founder and Enforcer

> "Wayne is probably the worst person to talk to because he will make sure that your account will be banned and removed from our system without any second guessing.  
> So far we have 1 user banned, and I've talked to Wayne about him. He's banned due to past interactions with Wayne.  
> So if that doesn't show how brutal Wayne could get, you can just ask Wayne yourself."  
> — Jack Finch

#### Jack Finch — Manager and Support Lead

> "I can't handle everything, so sometimes you’ll have to go to Wayne for certain things — like accessing user account info.  
> Good luck catching Wayne on a good day and not getting him mad while he’s trying to help you.  
> If you do get transferred to me, consider yourself lucky or unlucky — it depends on how you feel about having the owner who’s got other stuff to do.  
>   
> I *could* handle school cases, but I know how that would go — especially with how Wayne likes to handle them. I’d rather not get involved with schools trying to get user data.  
> So if you’re an admin from a school, just know that only our User Analyst team or Wayne will take your case. Wayne is brutal with school admins, especially if you don’t have solid proof against a user.  
> Honestly, trying to email support about this? It’s a waste of everyone’s time. And dealing with Wayne’s style isn’t for the faint of heart."  
> — Jack Finch
